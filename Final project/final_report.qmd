## Approaches undertaken {.center}

To find the best strategy we considered:  
- two intersecting moving averages  
- a single moving average and a selected volatility measure   
For each approach we considered a trend following and mean reverting strategy. 
We tried pair-trading (both based on prices and returns) and portfolio based on the assets volatility. **However, the best results were obtained with single asset trading.** 

We considered several combinations of parameters:  
- slow and fast EMAs for two intersecting moving averages  
- signal and slow EMAs for volatility breakout strategies  
- volatilities and multipliers of the lower-upper thresholds for VB.

## Approaches undertaken (cont'd)


For pair trading attempt, addtional filtering was applied. Filters based on correlation, cointegration and regression were applied, but none of them improved the overall results. 

For the final, single asset trades, **stop-loss condition** was added. If the cumulative PnL for the day was lower than $500 and $1000, for group 1 and 2 respectively, trades for the day were stopped.

To find the best strategy, we looked at the **sum of the final statistic for each quarter.**

## Data analysis

After the initial data preparation and cleaning, we conducted an analysis to determine the most suitable structure for the trading strategy. We examined whether better results could be achieved by trading a single asset, constructing a spread between assets, or building a multi-asset portfolio. The analyses performed are presented below.

We begin our analysis with data from group 1, which includes two assets: SP and NQ

```{python}
#|echo: false
#| output: false
import runpy

# REMEMBER that in the final report you should 
# summarise ALL teh QUARTERS - also the OUT-OF-SAMPLE

runpy.run_path("assets1.py")
```

### Individual assets
```{python}
#| echo: false
import pandas as pd
# import the csv file with strategy results
autocorr_df = pd.read_csv("autocorr_df.csv")

# Format the table
numeric_cols = autocorr_df.select_dtypes(include=['float', 'int']).columns

styled_table = (
    autocorr_df.style
    .format("{:+.5f}")
    .background_gradient(cmap="RdBu", vmin=-1, vmax=1)
    .set_properties(**{"text-align": "right", "font-size": "10px"})
    .hide(axis="index")
)

styled_table
```
The individual assets show small and mixed average returns, with no clear or consistent profitability across periods. This suggests that standalone single-asset strategies do not exhibit a strong or robust edge.

### Let's analyze the stability of the autocorrelations

```{python}
#| echo: false
import pandas as pd
# import the csv file with strategy results
stability_df = pd.read_csv("stability_df.csv")

# Format the table
numeric_cols = stability_df.select_dtypes(include=['float', 'int']).columns

styled_table = (
    stability_df.style
    .format("{:+.5f}")
    .background_gradient(cmap="RdBu", vmin=-1, vmax=1)
    .set_properties(**{"text-align": "right", "font-size": "10px"})
    .hide(axis="index")
)

styled_table
```
Autocorrelations are close to zero on average and display moderate variability over time. Although negative autocorrelation dominates slightly, the lack of strong and stable autocorrelation indicates limited predictability at the single-asset level.

###  Let's analyze the average volatility of the assets

```{python}
#| echo: false
import pandas as pd
# import the csv file with strategy results
vol_df = pd.read_csv("vol_df.csv")

# Format the table
numeric_cols = vol_df.select_dtypes(include=['float', 'int']).columns

styled_table = (
    vol_df.style
    .format("{:+.5f}")
    .background_gradient(cmap="RdBu", vmin=-1, vmax=1)
    .set_properties(**{"text-align": "right", "font-size": "10px"})
    .hide(axis="index")
)

styled_table
```
Both assets exhibit relatively low and comparable average volatility. This implies limited return dispersion, which further constrains the potential profitability of simple directional strategies.

### Conclusions for trading single assets
Overall, the analysis suggests that trading single assets individually is unlikely to deliver stable and attractive performance. This motivates exploring alternative structures such as spreads or multi-asset portfolios to improve robustness and exploit relative dynamics.

###  Spread

```{python}
#| echo: false
import pandas as pd
# import the csv file with strategy results
spread_autocorr_df = pd.read_csv("spread_autocorr_df.csv")

# Format the table
numeric_cols = spread_autocorr_df.select_dtypes(include=['float', 'int']).columns

styled_table = (
    spread_autocorr_df.style
    .format("{:+.5f}")
    .background_gradient(cmap="RdBu", vmin=-1, vmax=1)
    .set_properties(**{"text-align": "right", "font-size": "10px"})
    .hide(axis="index")
)

styled_table
```
The NQ–SP spread exhibits predominantly negative returns, with occasional larger drawdowns. This indicates that the raw spread, traded directionally, does not provide a consistent standalone profitability.

###  Spread stability

```{python}
#| echo: false
import pandas as pd
# import the csv file with strategy results
spread_stability_df = pd.read_csv("spread_stability_df.csv")

# Format the table
numeric_cols = spread_stability_df.select_dtypes(include=['float', 'int']).columns

styled_table = (
    spread_stability_df.style
    .format("{:+.5f}")
    .background_gradient(cmap="RdBu", vmin=-1, vmax=1)
    .set_properties(**{"text-align": "right", "font-size": "10px"})
    .hide(axis="index")
)

styled_table
```
The spread shows a clearly negative average autocorrelation with a high proportion of negative observations, suggesting mean-reverting behavior. This indicates better structural properties than single-asset autocorrelations.

###  Spread volatility

```{python}
#| echo: false
import pandas as pd
# import the csv file with strategy results
spread_vol_df = pd.read_csv("spread_vol_df.csv")

# Format the table
numeric_cols = spread_vol_df.select_dtypes(include=['float', 'int']).columns

styled_table = (
    spread_vol_df.style
    .format("{:+.5f}")
    .background_gradient(cmap="RdBu", vmin=-1, vmax=1)
    .set_properties(**{"text-align": "right", "font-size": "10px"})
    .hide(axis="index")
)

styled_table
```
The average volatility of the spread is lower than that of the individual assets, reflecting diversification effects and improved risk characteristics.

### Conclusions for spread

Compared to single-asset strategies, the spread demonstrates more stable statistical properties and lower volatility, making it a more promising candidate for further strategy development, particularly for mean-reversion-based approaches.

###  Portfolio

```{python}
#| echo: false
import pandas as pd
# import the csv file with strategy results
portfolio_autocorr_df = pd.read_csv("portfolio_autocorr_df.csv")

# Format the table
numeric_cols = portfolio_autocorr_df.select_dtypes(include=['float', 'int']).columns

styled_table = (
    portfolio_autocorr_df.style
    .format("{:+.5f}")
    .background_gradient(cmap="RdBu", vmin=-1, vmax=1)
    .set_properties(**{"text-align": "right", "font-size": "10px"})
    .hide(axis="index")
)

styled_table
```
The portfolio delivers small but consistently positive returns across periods, indicating improved performance compared to single-asset and spread strategies.

###  Portfolio stability

```{python}
#| echo: false
import pandas as pd
# import the csv file with strategy results
portfolio_stability_df = pd.read_csv("portfolio_stability_df.csv")

# Format the table
numeric_cols = portfolio_stability_df.select_dtypes(include=['float', 'int']).columns

styled_table = (
    portfolio_stability_df.style
    .format("{:+.5f}")
    .background_gradient(cmap="RdBu", vmin=-1, vmax=1)
    .set_properties(**{"text-align": "right", "font-size": "10px"})
    .hide(axis="index")
)

styled_table
```
Autocorrelations are close to zero on average, with a balanced distribution between positive and negative values. This suggests stable behavior without strong directional or mean-reverting bias.

###  Portfolio volatility

```{python}
#| echo: false
import pandas as pd
# import the csv file with strategy results
portfolio_vol_df = pd.read_csv("portfolio_vol_df.csv")

# Format the table
numeric_cols = portfolio_stability_df.select_dtypes(include=['float', 'int']).columns

styled_table = (
    portfolio_vol_df.style
    .format("{:+.5f}")
    .background_gradient(cmap="RdBu", vmin=-1, vmax=1)
    .set_properties(**{"text-align": "right", "font-size": "10px"})
    .hide(axis="index")
)

styled_table
```
The portfolio exhibits the lowest average volatility among the analyzed structures, reflecting effective diversification and improved risk-adjusted characteristics.

### Conlusions for portfolio

The portfolio structure provides the most stable and robust profile, combining positive average performance with low volatility. This makes it the most attractive candidate for further strategy development and optimization.

### Final conclusion

Based on the first analysis, the portfolio approach offers the most robust and reliable framework for strategy development and is therefore the preferred choice over single-asset and spread-based strategies.

## Second group of assets
Now we can move on to analyzing the second group of assets consisting of AUD, CAD, XAU, and XAG.

```{python}
#|echo: false
#| output: false
import runpy

# REMEMBER that in the final report you should 
# summarise ALL teh QUARTERS - also the OUT-OF-SAMPLE

runpy.run_path("assets2.py")
```

### Individual assets
```{python}
#| echo: false
import pandas as pd
# import the csv file with strategy results
autocorr_df = pd.read_csv("autocorr_df.csv")

# Format the table
numeric_cols = autocorr_df.select_dtypes(include=['float', 'int']).columns

styled_table = (
    autocorr_df.style
    .format("{:+.5f}")
    .background_gradient(cmap="RdBu", vmin=-1, vmax=1)
    .set_properties(**{"text-align": "right", "font-size": "10px"})
    .hide(axis="index")
)

styled_table
```
Individual assets (AUD, CAD, XAU, XAG) exhibit mixed and generally small returns, with no clear or consistent profitability across periods. This indicates a lack of a robust standalone trading edge at the single-asset level.

### Let's analyze the stability of the autocorrelations

```{python}
#| echo: false
import pandas as pd
# import the csv file with strategy results
stability_df = pd.read_csv("stability_df.csv")

# Format the table
numeric_cols = stability_df.select_dtypes(include=['float', 'int']).columns

styled_table = (
    stability_df.style
    .format("{:+.5f}")
    .background_gradient(cmap="RdBu", vmin=-1, vmax=1)
    .set_properties(**{"text-align": "right", "font-size": "10px"})
    .hide(axis="index")
)

styled_table
```
Autocorrelations are on average slightly negative, with a high proportion of negative observations for several assets. This suggests mild mean-reverting tendencies, although the strength and consistency vary across instruments.

###  Let's analyze the average volatility of the assets

```{python}
#| echo: false
import pandas as pd
# import the csv file with strategy results
vol_df = pd.read_csv("vol_df.csv")

# Format the table
numeric_cols = vol_df.select_dtypes(include=['float', 'int']).columns

styled_table = (
    vol_df.style
    .format("{:+.5f}")
    .background_gradient(cmap="RdBu", vmin=-1, vmax=1)
    .set_properties(**{"text-align": "right", "font-size": "10px"})
    .hide(axis="index")
)

styled_table
```
The assets display relatively low but heterogeneous volatility levels. Precious metals show higher volatility compared to FX pairs, which may offer more opportunity but also higher risk.

### Conclusions on trading individual

Overall, trading individual assets does not provide a stable or reliable performance profile. While some mean-reversion signals are present, their inconsistency suggests that more structured approaches, such as spreads or portfolios, are likely to be more effective.

###  Spread

```{python}
#| echo: false
import pandas as pd
# import the csv file with strategy results
spread_autocorr_df = pd.read_csv("spread_autocorr_df.csv")

# Format the table
numeric_cols = spread_autocorr_df.select_dtypes(include=['float', 'int']).columns

styled_table = (
    spread_autocorr_df.style
    .format("{:+.5f}")
    .background_gradient(cmap="RdBu", vmin=-1, vmax=1)
    .set_properties(**{"text-align": "right", "font-size": "10px"})
    .hide(axis="index")
)

styled_table
```
Both spreads exhibit predominantly negative returns, indicating that a simple directional spread strategy does not generate consistent profitability over time.

###  Spread stability

```{python}
#| echo: false
import pandas as pd
# import the csv file with strategy results
spread_stability_df = pd.read_csv("spread_stability_df.csv")

# Format the table
numeric_cols = spread_stability_df.select_dtypes(include=['float', 'int']).columns

styled_table = (
    spread_stability_df.style
    .format("{:+.5f}")
    .background_gradient(cmap="RdBu", vmin=-1, vmax=1)
    .set_properties(**{"text-align": "right", "font-size": "10px"})
    .hide(axis="index")
)

styled_table
```
The spreads display strongly negative average autocorrelation with a very high share of negative observations, pointing to pronounced mean-reverting behavior and more stable statistical properties than single assets.

###  Spread volatility

```{python}
#| echo: false
import pandas as pd
# import the csv file with strategy results
spread_vol_df = pd.read_csv("spread_vol_df.csv")

# Format the table
numeric_cols = spread_vol_df.select_dtypes(include=['float', 'int']).columns

styled_table = (
    spread_vol_df.style
    .format("{:+.5f}")
    .background_gradient(cmap="RdBu", vmin=-1, vmax=1)
    .set_properties(**{"text-align": "right", "font-size": "10px"})
    .hide(axis="index")
)

styled_table
```
Spread volatility is lower than the volatility of the underlying assets, reflecting diversification effects and improved risk control.

### Conclusions for spreads

While the spreads do not deliver stable positive returns on their own, their strong mean-reversion characteristics and reduced volatility make them suitable building blocks for more advanced strategies rather than standalone directional trades.

###  Portfolio

```{python}
#| echo: false
import pandas as pd
# import the csv file with strategy results
portfolio_autocorr_df = pd.read_csv("portfolio_autocorr_df.csv")

# Format the table
numeric_cols = portfolio_autocorr_df.select_dtypes(include=['float', 'int']).columns

styled_table = (
    portfolio_autocorr_df.style
    .format("{:+.5f}")
    .background_gradient(cmap="RdBu", vmin=-1, vmax=1)
    .set_properties(**{"text-align": "right", "font-size": "10px"})
    .hide(axis="index")
)

styled_table
```
The portfolio results show more balanced and less extreme returns compared to single assets and spreads, indicating improved diversification across asset groups.

###  Portfolio stability

```{python}
#| echo: false
import pandas as pd
# import the csv file with strategy results
portfolio_stability_df = pd.read_csv("portfolio_stability_df.csv")

# Format the table
numeric_cols = portfolio_stability_df.select_dtypes(include=['float', 'int']).columns

styled_table = (
    portfolio_stability_df.style
    .format("{:+.5f}")
    .background_gradient(cmap="RdBu", vmin=-1, vmax=1)
    .set_properties(**{"text-align": "right", "font-size": "10px"})
    .hide(axis="index")
)

styled_table
```
Autocorrelations are close to zero on average, with a higher share of negative observations, suggesting stable behavior without strong directional dependence and reduced sensitivity to regime changes.

###  Portfolio volatility

```{python}
#| echo: false
import pandas as pd
# import the csv file with strategy results
portfolio_vol_df = pd.read_csv("portfolio_vol_df.csv")

# Format the table
numeric_cols = portfolio_stability_df.select_dtypes(include=['float', 'int']).columns

styled_table = (
    portfolio_vol_df.style
    .format("{:+.5f}")
    .background_gradient(cmap="RdBu", vmin=-1, vmax=1)
    .set_properties(**{"text-align": "right", "font-size": "10px"})
    .hide(axis="index")
)

styled_table
```
Portfolio volatility is the lowest among the analyzed structures, highlighting the benefits of diversification and improved risk-adjusted characteristics.

### Conclusions for portfolio
The portfolio approach provides the most robust and stable framework, combining diversified returns, low volatility, and consistent statistical properties, making it the preferred choice for further strategy development.

### Summary
Across the analyzed assets (FX and metals), single-asset strategies do not exhibit stable or repeatable profitability, while spread-based approaches show improved statistical properties but lack consistent positive returns. The portfolio structure delivers the most robust results, combining lower volatility, more stable behavior, and improved diversification. Therefore, a portfolio-based approach is the preferred choice for trading these assets and provides the strongest foundation for further strategy development

**However, after adding transaction costs, the best strategies were for single assets in both cases.**



## Finally selected strategy for **group 1**

As a result of the trial and error process, we have ended with volatility breakout model with momentum strategy for **SP** with signal and slow EMA of 30 and 240 respectively. The window length used in volatilities calculation was set to 120, while the multiplier for lower and upper threshold was set to 1. The stop-loss assumption was set as maximum of $500 loss per day.



```{python}
#|echo: false
#| output: false
import runpy

# REMEMBER that in the final report you should 
# summarise ALL teh QUARTERS - also the OUT-OF-SAMPLE

runpy.run_path("your_final_strategy_group1.py")
```

## Summary of results for **group 1**

```{python}
#| echo: false

# import the csv file with strategy results
import pandas as pd
summary_data1_all_quarters = pd.read_csv("summary_data1_all_quarters.csv")

# Format the table
numeric_cols = summary_data1_all_quarters.select_dtypes(include=['float', 'int']).columns

styled_table = (
    summary_data1_all_quarters.style
    .format("{:.2f}", subset=numeric_cols)   # format numbers only
    .set_properties(**{"text-align": "right"})  
    .set_table_styles([
        {"selector": "th", "props": [("font-size", "10px")]},
        {"selector": "td", "props": [("font-size", "10px")]}
    ])
    .hide(axis = "index")   # << hides the index
)
styled_table
```

The table summarizes the quarterly performance of the selected strategy for Group 1. Across most quarters, the strategy generates positive gross and net Sharpe ratios, indicating consistent risk-adjusted performance. Gross and net PnL remain positive in the majority of periods, with net results reflecting reasonable transaction costs and execution effects.

While performance varies across quarters, drawdowns and net capital requirements remain controlled, suggesting stable risk exposure. Average daily transaction statistics are relatively stable over time, indicating consistent trading activity without excessive turnover.

Overall, the results demonstrate that the strategy delivers robust and repeatable performance across different market regimes, supporting its suitability as the final choice for Group 1.

## Equity line for **group 1** -- 2025Q3

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: 100%
from IPython.display import Image
Image(filename="data1_2025_Q3.png")
```

The equity line in 2025Q3 is highly volatile, with a deep mid-quarter drawdown followed by a sharp recovery, indicating unstable performance but strong late-period rebound.

## Equity line for **group 1** -- 2025Q4

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: 100%
from IPython.display import Image
Image(filename="data1_2025_Q4.png")
```

Here we can see an early drawdown followed by a steady recovery and a strong finish, suggesting improving performance and better end-of-period stability.



## Finally selected strategy for **group 2**

As a result of the trial and error process, we have ended with volatility breakout model with momentum strategy for **XAG** with signal and slow EMA of 30 and 240 respectively. The window length used in volatilities calculation was set to 60, while the multiplier for lower and upper threshold was set to 1. The stop-loss assumption was set as maximum of $1000 loss per day.

## Summary and conclusions

This project focused on the design and evaluation of intraday trading strategies based on technical indicators, including momentum and mean-reversion approaches, applied to high-frequency market data. The strategies were tested across multiple quarterly periods using realistic trading constraints such as restricted trading hours, flat-position rules around session boundaries, and transaction cost modeling.

Strategy performance was assessed using profit and loss (PnL), Sharpe ratios, and Calmar ratios computed from returns normalized by traded notional exposure, avoiding arbitrary capital assumptions. A daily stop-loss mechanism was introduced to limit downside risk and control large intraday losses. The implementation of stop-loss condition had the biggest impact on the results, making the strategies profitable. The stop-loss significantly improved drawdown behavior and return stability, turning otherwise unstable strategies into consistently profitable ones.

Overall, the results highlight that effective risk management and execution rules are as important as signal generation itself, and that simple technical strategies can achieve robust performance when complemented by disciplined stop-loss controls.
