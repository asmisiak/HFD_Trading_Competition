## Approaches undertaken

To find the best strategy we considered:  
- two intersecting moving averages  
- a single moving average and a selected volatility measure   
For each approach we considered a trend following and mean reverting strategy. 
We tried pair-trading (both based on prices and returns) and portfolio based on the assets volatility. **However, the best results were obtained with single asset trading.** 

We considered several combinations of parameters:  
- slow and fast EMAs for two intersecting moving averages  
- signal and slow EMAs for volatility breakout strategies  
- volatilities and multipliers of the lower-upper thresholds for VB.

## Approaches undertaken (cont'd)


For pair trading attempt, addtional filtering was applied. Filters based on correlation, cointegration and regression were applied, but none of them improved the overall results. 

For the final, single asset trades, **stop-loss condition** was added. If the cumulative PnL for the day was lower than $500 and $1000, for group 1 and 2 respectively, trades for the day were stopped.

To find the best strategy, we looked at the **sum of the final statistic for each quarter.**


## Finally selected strategy for **group 1**


As a result of the trial and error process, we have ended with volatility breakout model for **SP** with signal and slow EMA of 30 and 240 respectively. The window length used in volatilities calculation was set to 120, while the multiplier for lower and upper threshold was set to 1. The stop-loss assumption was set as maximum of $500 loss per day.

runpy.run_path("your_final_strategy_group1.py")
``` 


## Summary of results for **group 1**

```{python}
#| echo: false

# import the csv file with strategy results
import pandas as pd
summary_data1_all_quarters = pd.read_csv("summary_data1_all_quarters.csv")

# Format the table
numeric_cols = summary_data1_all_quarters.select_dtypes(include=['float', 'int']).columns

styled_table = (
    summary_data1_all_quarters.style
    .format("{:.2f}", subset=numeric_cols)   # format numbers only
    .set_properties(**{"text-align": "right"})  
    .set_table_styles([
        {"selector": "th", "props": [("font-size", "20px")]},
        {"selector": "td", "props": [("font-size", "20px")]}
    ])
    .hide(axis = "index")   # << hides the index
)
styled_table
```
The overall results look good - net Sharpe Ratio and net PnL is negative only for one quarter, Q1 2025. Net PnL is the highest for first and last analyzed quarter. Final statistics sum up to **28,57**.

## Equity line for **group 1** -- 2023Q1

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: 100%
#| fig-width: 12
#| fig-height: 8
from IPython.display import Image
Image(filename="data1_2023_Q1.png")
```

We can see that both gross and net cumulative PnL is rising, reaching almost $25,000. Both series are following the same trend.

## Equity line for **group 1** -- 2023Q3

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: 100%
from IPython.display import Image
Image(filename="data1_2023_Q3.png")
```

More volatility can be observed - also bigger difference bewteen gross and net PnL. However, still positive PnL.

## Equity line for **group 1** -- 2023Q4

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: 100%
from IPython.display import Image
Image(filename="data1_2023_Q4.png")
```
Rising trend of both gross and net PnL. Strategy behavior is consistent. A little divergence can be observed over time.

## Equity line for **group 1** -- 2024Q2

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: 100%
from IPython.display import Image
Image(filename="data1_2024_Q2.png")
```
The start of the quarter was really good - gross and net PnL close together and rising quickly. However, the second half of the quarter it turned into losing startegy. Fortunately the end cumulative PnL is still positive.

## Equity line for **group 1** -- 2024Q4

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: 100%
from IPython.display import Image
Image(filename="data1_2024_Q4.png")
```
Strong, upward trend for both gross and net PnL. The gap is rising slowly - the trading frequency is quite low. Final cumulative net PnL is lower than it could be - strong decrease in last couple of days.

## Equity line for **group 1** -- 2025Q1

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: 100%
from IPython.display import Image
Image(filename="data1_2025_Q1.png")
```
Strongly volatile both gross and net PnL - mostly in the negative values. Not the best strategy for this quarter.

## Equity line for **group 1** -- 2025Q2

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: 100%
from IPython.display import Image
Image(filename="data1_2025_Q2.png")
```
Sharp increase in first 15 days with low costs. Then stable for the rest of the quarter - strong final cumulative net PnL of more than $18,000.


## Summary of results for **group 2**

Provide a **general summary** (approach and a set of **final parameters**) for assets from **group 2**.
(e.g. momentum strategy, cross over of two exponential moving averages EMA10 and EMA60).
